## Summary
Canadian programs for Ukrainian refugees are not published yet. The first new programs are expected in about one week. Meanwhile, Canadian immigration prioritizes standard processes for Ukrainians. 
> According to unofficial sources, a tourist (temporary resident) visa approval currently takes about 2 days.

## The standard visa application process
1. **Apply for a visa [online.](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/applications/visa.asp).** 
Available from Ukraine or abroad
> IRCC will waive fees, retroactive to February 22, 2022
2. **Provide biometrics (photo, fingerprints).**It has to be done in person, currently not available in Ukraine. 
> If you provided biometrics for Canadian visas in the past, they still may be valid, you can check it here 
3. **Provide your passport if your visa is approved.** You will receive instructions on how to provide your passport. You will have 30 days to do it. Currently not available in Ukraine but it can be done in most other countries.
> This is a standard process for a visitor (temporary resident) visa. However, IRCC also prioritizes Ukrainians’ applications for permanent residence, proof of citizenship, and citizenship grant for adoption.

## New measures 
Canadian immigration authorities are currently working on the following pathways:
- **Canada-Ukraine Authorization for Emergency Travel.**
The program to temporarily live and work in Canada waiving most normal visa requirements.
**For who:** All Ukrainian nationals. 
**Term:** Temporary (at least 2 years). 
- **Special family reunification sponsorship.**
Canadian analogue of “green card”
**For who:** Immediate and extended family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residents.
**Term:** Permanent.
- **Open work permits for Ukrainians who are currently in Canada.**
The program to stay and work in Canada. 
**For who:** For Ukrainians who are already in Canada.
**Term:** Temporary.
## What it means in practice.
Ukrainian refugees can apply for tourist or other visas right now from Ukraine or other countries and to receive them in a very short time. However, they will have to finalize the process from abroad (visa centres in Ukraine do not operate currently.) After the new program launches, they will be able to get a work permit.
The simplified way to enter Canada is expected around March 17, 2022.
## More useful info.
### Not a citizen of Ukraine?
Current measures apply to all current residents of Ukraine, not citizens only (according to the official support team). As for the coming measures, there is no information yet.
### Not vaccinated or vaccinated or vaccinated with vaccine not recognized in Canada?
Ukrainian nationals get an exemption and can enter Canada if they have a temporary resident (visitor visa), temporary resident permit or written notice of approval for an application for permanent residence.
### Have immediate family in Canada?
Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and registered Indians can sponsor their spouses, common-law or conjugal partners, and dependent children (including adopted children) to come to Canada. They can submit the application normally, and IRCC will prioritize it for the family members who are Ukrainian nationals outside of Canada.
